# Motivation

It is a consensus that education is a core value of our society and everyone that achieved some kind of success most
likely did it relying on eventual education opportunities.

From a collective perspective, it is one of the main features that makes our species so unique and powerful as no other
animals can spread knowledge as we do, and assuming we want to increase our chances against the challenges of the future
of humankind, we must empower as many individuals as possible with the light of knowledge so that everyone can be
impactful in some degree to some aspect of society.

In light of this, isn't it contradictory that there are so few initiatives and so many people without resources to fetch
education?

We may still not be able to change the uneven nature of our society. Still, if we look closer, we will find so many
people out there with plenty of resources, good intentions, and yet no optimal way of helping someone in need of a
kick-starter.

# The issues with the existing solutions

Currently, if one wants to invest money in another person's studies, one has to either know someone in need of help or
trust a third party to receive the money and redirect it to people in need.

This model has three main problems:

### The social bubble problem

Most of the time, the student candidates that could be more impacted are geographically and, sociologically speaking,
very far from potential investors.

Because of that, resources are sometimes directed to individuals who could theoretically manage to pay for their
education, while others who need it stay in the dark.

### The men in the middle problem

The necessity of the involvement of a third party often causes a lot of trouble since, as we know, human interaction is
error-prone.

Factors like corruption and poor management often take an unwanted role in the operation, making it slower and less
efficient.

Also, most of the time, there is no way to track the donated money, thus making donating to education a lot less
inviting.

### The lack of incentive problem

Sometimes, one wants to loan/invest money in someone instead of donating it. In the current model, the student has to be
making some money to start paying its debt, which usually takes some time.

This fact by itself makes paying someone's studies a not so good investment.

# The proposed solution

We propose creating a platform henceforth called StarT, which allows users to discover/invest in high potential,
community-curated student prospects.

The investment process happens peer-to-contract through the blockchain, making it fully trackable, eliminating a third
party's need.

The investment transaction generates new STAR Tokens, dividing them between the investor and the platform star pool,
bringing it to a whole new level of potential for profitability and, once the platform is well spread, quick return.

# STAR Tokens (STAR)

### What are STAR Tokens?

STAR Tokens are transactional erc20 tokens that the StarT platform generates to incentivize investors to fund students.

While one can think of STAR Tokens as the cryptocurrency of the StarT network, it is more accurate to refer to it as the
difference in the student's impact on society, allowed by the funds investors raise, once it concludes its studies.

### How many STAR Tokens the StarT platform gives per investment?

The StarT platform gives new STAR tokens to investors according to the following formula:

(A*S)/C

Where:

- A = The invested amount
- S = The student score
- C = The current amount of STAR Tokens in circulation

After that, 90% of it is given to the investor, while the other 10% stays on the platform.

The above formula incentivizes investors to fund students with high potential while slowly decreasing the mint of new
tokens to avoid high inflation rates.

It also helps the platform to grow in its early days by giving back more potential value in its early stages.

# Partners

Our main partners are educational institutions that integrate with the StarT platform, allowing for a contract-to-peer
on-demand payment model.

This model makes it easy to return the unused part of the invested value to the investors if the student doesn't meet
the criteria proposed by himself in his profile.

Also, helping to market out StarT will benefit these companies as more students will likely join the institutions
because of it.

Indeed, it will be good for the institution's image to be associated with a disruptive charity for student solution
initiative. After all, who could be against it?

Partners can also choose to accept STAR Tokens as part of the payment for the services it provides, which brings
immediate value to the tokens even outside exchanges.

# Solution components

### Student registration:

A website that allows students to create an investment proposal describing its situation in dept, providing documents
and selecting one of the possible funding options:

- **Peer-to-partner**: Selecting a partner institution allows for the payment model described in
  the [Partners](#markdown-header-partners) section. It significantly increases the user score.
- **Peer-to-peer**: The money flows directly to the student wallet on the specified dates.

The student can also include additional requests, like extra money to buy a notebook. These are always sent directly to
the student wallet.

### Student score calculation:

The student score allows for a quick filter on the crowdsourcing platform. A higher user score also means that investing
in this student will likely generate more STAR tokens than another with a lower score.

The platform calculates the student score taking into account variables as:

- The completion status of the profile page data.
- The funding model that the student selected
- The per capita income of the student residence
- And especially, community upvotes and downvotes.

### Student crowdfunding platform:

Allows for users to browse all open student proposals and to invest any amount of ?ETH? on a chosen student. It also
allows for upvoting and downvoting student proposals.
