# Motivation
It is a consensus that education is a core value of our society and everyone that achieved some
kind of success in life did it because it eventually had the opportunity of being educated.

From a collective perspective, it is one of the main features that makes our species so unique and powerful since no other 
animal can spread knowledge as we do, and assuming we want to increase our chances against the challenges of the future of humankind,
we must empower as many individuals as possible with the light of knowledge so that everyone can be impactful to some degree.

In light of this, isn't it contradictory that there are so few initiatives and so many people without resources to fetch
education?

We may still not be able to change the uneven nature of our society. Still, if we look closer, we may find so many people
out there with plenty of resources, good intentions, and yet no optimal way of helping someone in need of a kick-starter.
